# Quantum Computing
This project is about quantum computing simulation that is qubit generator and quantum gates on qubit states.  Quantum gates only for single, two, and three-qubit. But we can make an n-qubit state simply.
Qubit $|0>$ state definition conventionally as array 2x1 $[1,0]$ and qubit 1 as $[0,1]$
