# Quantum Computing
This project is about quantum computing simulation that is qubit generator and quantum gates on qubit states. Then I use qubit generator and quantum gates to construct one of Bell State.

## Qubit State
   - |0> as matrix [1,0]
   - |1> as matrix [0,1]

## Quantum Gates
1. Single-qubit
   - Identity gate
   - Pauli gate
   - Phase gate
   - U gate
   - Hadamard gate
2. Two-qubit
   - Controlled-phase gate
   - CNOT gate
3. Three-qubit
   - Toffoli gate
   - Fredkin gate
